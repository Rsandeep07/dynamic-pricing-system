# Dynamic Surge Pricing Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing surge pricing behavior in dynamic systems
where prices fluctuate based on real-time demand and supply conditions.
The objective is to understand the key drivers behind surge price variations
and extract insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Problem Statement
Dynamic pricing systems are widely used in real-world platforms to manage
demand–supply imbalances. Sudden demand spikes, limited supply, time-based
patterns, and external factors such as weather and location can lead to
price surges. Understanding these drivers is critical for building fair
and efficient pricing strategies.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze how demand and supply levels influence surge pricing
- Study the impact of time, weather, and location on surge multipliers
- Identify patterns associated with abnormal price increases
- Generate insights that can support automated pricing or decision systems

---

## Workflow
- Data Cleaning and Validation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature-Level Analysis of Pricing Drivers
- Surge Multiplier Analysis
- Business Interpretation of Results

---

## Key Insights
- Surge prices increase significantly during high demand and low supply conditions
- Time-of-day and location play a crucial role in surge behavior
- External factors such as weather amplify price fluctuations during peak periods
- Abnormal demand spikes are closely associated with higher surge multipliers

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to understand and
interpret dynamic pricing behavior. The insights derived from this analysis
can be extended to build predictive or rule-based pricing systems in
real-world applications.
